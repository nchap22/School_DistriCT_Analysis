The math mean score is below: student_df["math_score"].mean() = 64.67

I think this shows that some of the budget needs to go into help improving math scores since overall the score is on the lower side.

Also it looks like public schools have a higher budget then charter schools. school_type Charter 872625.656236 Public 911195.558251

However, when looking at average reading and math scores for the two school types, both scools have scores on the lower side, especially eith ninth grade readin and llth and 12th grade math scores.

Additionally, I think there needs to be an anlaysis that groups by schools and lists all average reading and math scores per school and we can see which schools themselves have lower scores and use some of the budget to help improves scores at these specific schools.
